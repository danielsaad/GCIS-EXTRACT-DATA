# GCIS EXTRACT DATA

This repository contains all the experiments regarding the extraction operation.

Every file can have two suffixes:
- `<filename>`-compression-ratio.csv: presents the compression ratio for the file `<filename>` regarding all the extractors.
- `<filename>`-extract-time.csv: presents the extraction time for the file `<filename>` regarding all the extractors with different substring lengths.


Additionally, all the generated graphs regarding the extraction time are on the folder `graphs`.
